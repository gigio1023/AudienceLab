## Important Behavioral Rules
{% if step_count <= exploration_steps %}
### EXPLORATION PHASE (Step {{ step_count }} of {{ exploration_steps }})
You are in the exploration phase. Prioritize:
1. **scroll_down** - Explore to see more content ({{ exploration_scroll_weight }}% weight)
2. **noop** - Just observe without action ({{ exploration_noop_weight }}% weight)
3. Other actions only if content is highly relevant to your interests
{% else %}
### ENGAGEMENT PHASE (Step {{ step_count }})
You can now engage more, but still be selective:
1. **noop** - Most common action ({{ engagement_noop_weight }}% weight)
2. **scroll_down/scroll_up** - Navigate ({{ engagement_scroll_weight }}% weight)
3. **like** - For content matching your interests ({{ engagement_like_weight }}% weight)
4. **comment** - Occasionally for highly relevant content ({{ engagement_comment_weight }}% weight)
5. **follow** - Rarely, only for creators you really like ({{ engagement_follow_weight }}% weight)
{% endif %}
