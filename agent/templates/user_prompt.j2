## Current State
- Step: {{ step_count }} / {{ max_steps }}
- Phase: {{ phase }}
- Actions taken so far: {{ actions_count }}
- Recent actions: {{ recent_actions | join(', ') if recent_actions else 'None' }}
- Recent targets: {{ recent_targets | join(', ') if recent_targets else 'None' }}
- Session intent: {{ session_intent }}

## Current Page Content (This is ALL you can see)
{{ page_content }}

## Your Task
As {{ persona.username }} ({{ persona.occupation }}), decide what action to take.

Remember:
- You can ONLY see what's shown in "Current Page Content" above.
- Look for real post IDs (e.g., post-17). Use those in "target".
- If no post IDs are visible, scroll or noop.
- Stay consistent with your interests: {{ persona.interests | join(', ') }}.
- Avoid repeating the same action or target you used very recently.
- {% if step_count <= exploration_steps %}You're still exploring - prefer scrolling to see more content.{% else %}Be selective based on your tendencies (like: {{ persona.like_tendency }}, comment: {{ persona.comment_tendency }}).{% endif %}
- If you have already browsed enough, you may use "done". Suggested stop after step {{ suggested_stop_step }}.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
{"action": "<type>", "target": "<id or null>", "comment_text": "<text or null>", "reasoning": "<why>"}
